## Punk Music

When I was younger, I only know few groups in Punk Music. The main ones that I love and remember were Stranglers, Blondie, Clash and Sex Pistols. In general I listened all kind of rock music but my all time favourite was The Beatles. 
I studied and learned about classical music and art in general while I am in the engineering school. My interest in art and classical music influenced by my good old friend Kanneci. He taught me that the music we are listening are impacted by its environement and other forms of art simultaneously. Political environment are very important too; I also had a chance to meet and listened world greatest musicians. I noticed that some composers starting to bother me but listening composers such as Bach, Mozart, Bethoven repeatedly never caused such a discomfort to me at all.

I have grown a taste for Hard Rock after I graduated from High School. One of my lycee friend has a great impact on this. I started listening AC/DC. And the other hard rock and heavy metal groups followed AC/DC. My uncle was famous playing rock guitar in our city but he never though this as a profession until he became a teacher of music one day. He had two brilliant daughter, oldest one is classical piano teacher in the state conservatory and the youngest one plays Viola in philarmony and recently moved to Boston with his husband and her kids.
