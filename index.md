## Punk Music

When I was younger, I only knew few groups in Punk Music. The main ones that I love and remember were Stranglers, Blondie, Clash and Sex Pistols. In general I listened all kind of rock music but my all time favourite was The Beatles. 
I studied and learned about classical music and art while I am in the engineering school. My interest in art and classical music influenced by my good old friend [Kanneci](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmet_Kanneci). Kanneci studied with a lot of major influencer in Classical Guitar. He was a pupil of [Julian Bream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bream) and [José Tomás](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Tom%C3%A1s). He also studied with Segovia and played to him several times. He taught me that the music we are listening today are impacted by its environement and from other forms of art simultaneously. I also had a chance to meet and listen the world greatest musicians. Then my all time favourite became baroque music. I noticed that some musicians were starting to bother me but listening composers such as Bach, Mozart, Bethoven repeatedly never caused such a discomfort at all.

## Hard Rock
I have grown a taste for Hard Rock after I graduated from High School. One of my high school friend had a great impact on this. I started listening AC/DC. And the other hard rock and heavy metal groups followed AC/DC.

## Roots
My uncle was knownplaying rock guitar best in our city but he never thought it as a profession until he became a teacher of music. He had two brilliant daughters, oldest one is classical piano teacher in the state conservatory in Capitol City and the youngest one used to play Violin in philarmony and shre recently moved to Boston with his husband and her kids. When I was a kid, I was listening his records at home and play with his Marshall guitar amplifier.

My son wanted to play piano at age 4, my wife took him to the Baldwin Music Education Center once in a week. He continued his classes with various teachers. He also attended University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music. He played alto and baritone saxophone in Sycamore schools and he was the synth player with the band at the band. He visited Taiwan for concert program with other players from CCM. He played several alto-saxophone and piano pieces with his friends.  

## Development
I didn't attempt to write and talk before. This may be my first non-technical conversation but still titled "Development". I like developing applications. After I started developing new applications, I felt that I was not able to create as many application as I wanted to, so I begin working with teams to create applications and serve others. While I was totally introvert developing my applications, I noticed that I am becoming extrovert when I am working in a team

My passion is in usability. I believe web based applications are the basis of what we are developing to expand the usability and compatibility accross different devices. Most languages have web frameworks that streamline the development of web based applications.

I learned the importance of testing but I also learned about quality should be embedded to your process instead of validating later. There are some principles that I learn but I always regret that I learned them late. I wish I would experience them 10 years earlier.

I will try to summarize these principles that I value. First one I value is continuous learning. It's important that you talk using the same language as others. I am not a native English speaker. I am worst in langiage studies but I still learnt German and a littl bit Spanish and French that I started forgetting them since I am not using them at all.

## Membership

While I was still thinking about how to involve in the **Broadway Toastmasters** club, evaluating my options for roles where I can be helpful; suddenly I found myself nominated for this role. First of all, thank you, for your trust in me. And thank you for encouraging me for this role; I couldn't find myself worthy of such responsibility for another decade or so.

I saw that there're no other candidates for this role; even the election results sound easy, the responsibility is not. So thanks again, for deciding for me. I promise that I will do my job as good as possible. If you have any suggestion, please feel free to share them with me. One think I learn in my life, not early enough, we are not alone in any journey. I will synthesize your thoughts with my personal opinion.

We are an educational organization, we came here to improve our relationship and public speaking skills. We have to pay attention to each other and provide support in this journey. Here's some challenges that I am looking for your help.
- While quality is important, we have to support as many members as possible for W&S. 
- The efforts to improvement is personal and we need to focus individuals.
- We shouldn't degrade our _process quality_ to increase our influence and member base.

I am transparent, open to criticism, and I have a thick skin. But I cannot invent the wheel alone, I will definitely need your help to do that.
