## Punk Music

Before I moved to US, I only know few groups who represent Punk Music. THe main ones were Stranglers, Blondie and Sex Pistols. In general I listened all kind of rock music but my all time favourite was The Beatles. I learned to listen and love the classical music by listening same music in classical guitar over and over. I played the classical guitar but not much with a success. My interest in art and classical music grown with my good old friend Kanneci. I noticed that some composers starting to bother me but listening composers such as Bach, Mozart, Bethoven repeatedly never caused a discomfort to me at all.

I have grown a taste for Hard Rock after I graduated from High School. One of my lycee friend has a great impact on this. I started listening AC/DC. And the other hard rock and heavy metal groups followed AC/DC. My uncle was famous playing rock guitar in our city but he never though this as a profession until he became a teacher of music one day. He had two brilliant daughter, oldest one is classical piano teacher in the state conservatory and the youngest one plays Viola in philarmony and recently moved to Boston with his husband and her kids.
