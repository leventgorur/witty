## Punk Music

When I was younger, I only knew few groups in Punk Music. The main ones that I love and remember were Stranglers, Blondie, Clash and Sex Pistols. In general I listened all kind of rock music but my all time favourite was The Beatles. 
I studied and learned about classical music and art in general while I am in the engineering school. My interest in art and classical music influenced by my good old friend Kanneci. Kanneci studied with a lot of major influencer in Classical Guitar. He was a pupil of Julian Bream and José Tomás. He taught me that the music we are listening today are impacted by its environement and from other forms of art simultaneously. I also had a chance to meet and listen the world greatest musicians. Then my all time favourite became baroque music. I noticed that some musicians were starting to bother me but listening composers such as Bach, Mozart, Bethoven repeatedly never caused such a discomfort at all.

I have grown a taste for Hard Rock after I graduated from High School. One of my high school friend had a great impact on this. I started listening AC/DC. And the other hard rock and heavy metal groups followed AC/DC. My uncle was famous playing rock guitar in our city but he never thought as a profession until he became a teacher of music. He had two brilliant daughters, oldest one is classical piano teacher in the state conservatory in Capitol City and the youngest one used to play Violin in philarmony and shre recently moved to Boston with his husband and her kids. 

My son wanted to play piano at age 4, my wife took him to the Baldwin Music Education Center once in a week. He continued his classes with various teachers. He also attended University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music. He played alto and baritone saxophone in Sycamore schools and he was the synth player with the band at the band. He visited Taiwan for concert program with other players from CCM. He played several alto-saxophone and piane pieces with his friends.
